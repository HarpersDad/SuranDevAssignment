On a linux system

Open the terminal by searching for it in the dashboard or pressing Ctrl + Alt + T.

Navigate the terminal to the directory where the script is located using the cd command.

Type python main.py in the terminal to execute the script.

The script will present the user with two options for sorting.

If the script is python3, use python3 in the terminal command:python3 main.py


On Mac OS

Open terminal and navigate to the file in the directory.

Once there, type python3 main.py and press enter.

The user will see the input commands and will be able to choose how to sort the file.



In both environments the user will see an additional input option after they choose which type of sort to run.  This will allow the user to check if the output was done correctly.
